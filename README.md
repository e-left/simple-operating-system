# Simple operating system 

This project is a simple operating system designed from the ground-up using x86 assembly for the bootloader and C for the kernel.
It is based on the book `Writing a Simple Operating System - from Scratch` by Nick Blundell.

Status update: makefiles fixed,currently facing a problem at drivers/screen.c,on the `print_char` and `print_at` functions.

**Work in progress.**
